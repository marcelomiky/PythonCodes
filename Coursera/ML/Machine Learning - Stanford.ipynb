    "\n",
    "There's a party, room full of people, all sitting around, all talking at the same time and there are all these overlapping voices because everyone is talking at the same time, and it is almost hard to hear the person in front of you. \n",
    "\n",
    "So maybe at a cocktail party with two people, two people talking at the same time, and it's a somewhat small cocktail party. And we're going to put two microphones in the room so there are microphones, and because these microphones are at two different distances from the speakers, each microphone records a different combination of these two speaker voices. \n",
    "\n",
    "Maybe speaker one is a little louder in microphone one and maybe speaker two is a little bit louder on microphone 2 because the 2 microphones are at different positions relative to the 2 speakers, but each microphone would cause an **overlapping combination of both speakers' voices**. \n",
    "\n",
    "So here's an actual recording of two speakers recorded by a researcher. Let me play for you the first, what the first microphone sounds like. \n",
    "\n",

    "*Uno (one), dos (two), tres (three), cuatro (four), cinco (five), seis (six), siete (seven), ocho (eight), nueve (nine) y diez (ten).*\n",
    "\n",
    "So we can do, is take these two microphone recorders and give them to an Unsupervised Learning algorithm called the cocktail party algorithm, and tell the algorithm - find structure in this data for you. And what the algorithm will do is listen to these audio recordings and say, you know it sounds like the two audio recordings are being added together or that have being summed together to produce these recordings that we had. Moreover, what the cocktail party algorithm will do is separate out these two audio sources that were being added or being summed together to form other recordings and, in fact, here's the first output of the cocktail party algorithm. \n",

    "\n",
    "*One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.*\n",
    "\n",
    "When you give these two microphone recordings to the same algorithm, what it does, is again say, you know, it sounds like there are two audio sources, and moreover, the album says, here is the first of the audio sources I found. \n",
    "\n",
    "*One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.*\n",
    "\n",
    "So that wasn't perfect, it got the voice, but it also got a little bit of the music in there. Then here's the second output to the algorithm. \n",

    "Not too bad, in that second output it managed to get rid of the voice entirely. And just, you know, cleaned up the music, got rid of the counting from one to ten. \n",

It seems like in order to, you know, build this application, it seems like to do this audio processing you need to write a ton of code or maybe link into like a bunch of synthesizer Java libraries that process audio, seems like a really complicated program, to do this audio, separating out audio and so on. \n",

    "It take researchers a long time to come up with this line of code. I'm not saying this is an easy problem, But it turns out that when you use the right programming environment, many learning algorithms can be really short programs.\n",

    "\n",
    "Octave, is free open source software, and using a tool like Octave or Matlab, many learning algorithms become just a few lines of code to implement. Later in this class, I'll just teach you a little bit about how to use Octave and you'll be implementing some of these algorithms in Octave. Or if you have Matlab you can use that too. \n",

    "**What I've seen after having taught machine learning for almost a decade now, is that, you learn much faster if you use Octave as your programming environment, and if you use Octave as your learning tool and as your prototyping tool, it'll let you learn and prototype learning algorithms much more quickly.**\n",

It turns out that by doing things this way, you can often get your algorithm to work much faster than if you were starting out in C++. \n",

    "Finally, to wrap up this video, I have one quick review question for you. \n",
    "\n",
    "We talked about Unsupervised Learning, which is a learning setting where you give the algorithm a ton of data and just ask it to find structure in the data for us.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Given a set of news articles found on the web, group them into sets of articles about the same stories.\n",
    "- Given a database of customers data, automatically discover market segments and groups customers into different market segments.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, hopefully, you've remembered the spam folder problem. If you have labeled data, you know, with spam and non-spam e-mail, we'd treat this as a Supervised Learning problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "The news story example, that's exactly the Google News example that we saw in this video, we saw how you can use a clustering algorithm to cluster these articles together so that's Unsupervised Learning. \n",
    "\n",
    "The market segmentation example I talked a little bit earlier, you can do that as an Unsupervised Learning problem because I am just gonna get my algorithm data and ask it to discover market segments automatically. \n",
    "\n",
    "And the final example, diabetes, well, that's actually just like our breast cancer example from the last video. Only instead of, you know, good and bad cancer tumors or benign or malignant tumors we instead have diabetes or not and so we will use that as a supervised, we will solve that as a Supervised Learning problem just like we did for the breast tumor data. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, that's it for Unsupervised Learning and in the next video, we'll delve more into specific learning algorithms and start to talk about just how these algorithms work and how we can, how you can go about implementing them. "

The right hand side, this is asserting, I'm just making a claim that the values of a and b are the same, and so whereas you can write a := a + 1, that means increment a by 1, hopefully I won't ever write a = a + 1 because that's just wrong. a and a + 1 can never be equal to the same values.

Technically in mathematics you call this a partial derivative and call this a derivative, depending on the number of parameters in the function J. But that's a mathematical technicality. And so for the purpose of this lecture, think of these partial symbols and d, d theta 1, as exactly the same thing. And don't worry about what the real difference is. I'm gonna try to use the mathematically precise notation, but for our purposes these two notations are really the same thing. And so let's see what this equation will do. So we're going to compute this derivative, not sure if you've seen derivatives in calculus before, but what the derivative at this point does, is basically saying, now let's take the tangent to that point, like that straight line, that red line, is just touching this function, and let's look at the slope of this red line. That's what the derivative is, it's saying what's the slope of the line that is just tangent to the function. the slope of a line is just this height divided by this horizontal thing. Now, this line has a positive slope, so it has a positive derivative. And so my update to theta is going to be theta 1, it gets updated as theta 1, minus alpha times some positive number. \n",

So it ends up taking a huge step, and now my cost functions have strong roots. Cuz it starts off with this value, and now, my values are strong in verse. Now my derivative points to the left, it says I should decrease data. But if my learning is too big, I may take a huge step going from here all the way to out there. So we end up being over there, right? And if my is too big, we can take another huge step on the next elevation and kind of overshoot and overshoot and so on, until you already notice I'm actually getting further and further away from the minimum.

    "0:20\n",
    "So this was what we worked out in the previous videos. This gradient descent algorithm which you should be familiar and here's the linear regression model with our linear hypothesis and our squared error cost function. What we're going to do is apply gradient descent to minimize our squared error cost function. Now in order to apply gradient descent, in order to, you know, write this piece of code, the key term we need is this derivative term over here. So you need to figure out what is this partial derivative term and plugging in the definition of the cause function j. This turns out to be this. \n",

And turns out we need to figure out what is this partial derivative for two cases for J equals 0 and J equals 1. So we want to figure out what is this partial derivative for both the theta 0 case and the theta 1 case. And I'm just going to write out the answers. It turns out this first term is, simplifies to 1/M sum from over my training step of just that of X(i)- Y(i) and for this term partial derivative let's write the theta 1, it turns out I get this term. Minus Y(i) times X(i). Okay and computing these partial derivatives, so we're going from this equation. Right going from this equation to either of the equations down there. Computing those partial derivative terms requires some multivariate calculus. If you know calculus, feel free to work through the derivations yourself and check that if you take the derivatives, you actually get the answers that I got. But if you're less familiar with calculus, don't worry about it and it's fine to just take these equations that were worked out and you won't need to know calculus or anything like that, in order to do the homework so let's implement gradient descent and get back to work. \n",

    "4:24\n",
    "So. Let's see how gradient descent works. One of the issues we saw with gradient descent is that it can be susceptible to local optima. So when I first explained gradient descent I showed you this picture of it going downhill on the surface, and we saw how depending on where you initialize it, you can end up at different local optima. You will either wind up here or here. But, it turns out that that the cost function for linear regression is always going to be a bow shaped function like this. The technical term for this is that this is called a convex function. \n",
    "5:03\n",
    "And I'm not gonna give the formal definition for what is a convex function, C, O, N, V, E, X. But informally a convex function means a bowl shaped function and so this function doesn't have any local optima except for the one global optimum. And does gradient descent on this type of cost function which you get whenever you're using linear regression it will always converge to the global optimum. Because there are no other local optimum, global optimum. So now let's see this algorithm in action. \n",
    "5:38\n",
    "As usual, here are plots of the hypothesis function and of my cost function j. And so let's say I've initialized my parameters at this value. Let's say, usually you initialize your parameters at zero, zero. Theta zero and theta equals zero. But for the demonstration, in this physical infrontation I've initialized you know, theta zero at 900 and theta one at about -0.1 okay. And so this corresponds to h(x)=-900-0.1x, [the intercept should be +900] is this line, out here on the cost function. Now, if we take one step in gradient descent, we end up going from this point out here, over to the down and left, to that second point over there. And you notice that my line changed a little bit, and as I take another step of gradient descent, my line on the left will change. \n",
    "6:41\n",
    "Right? And I've also moved to a new point on my cost function. \n",
    "6:47\n",
    "And as I take further steps of gradient descent, I'm going down in cost. So my parameters and such are following this trajectory. \n",
    "6:57\n",
    "And if you look on the left, this corresponds with hypotheses. That seem to be getting to be better and better fits to the data \n",
    "7:08\n",
    "until eventually I've now wound up at the global minimum and this global minimum corresponds to this hypothesis, which gets me a good fit to the data. \n",
    "7:21\n",
    "And so that's gradient descent, and we've just run it and gotten a good fit to my data set of housing prices. And you can now use it to predict, you know, if your friend has a house size 1250 square feet, you can now read off the value and tell them that I don't know maybe they could get $250,000 for their house. Finally just to give this another name it turns out that the algorithm that we just went over is sometimes called batch gradient descent. And it turns out in machine learning I don't know I feel like us machine learning people were not always great at giving names to algorithms. But the term batch gradient descent refers to the fact that in every step of gradient descent, we're looking at all of the training examples. So in gradient descent, when computing the derivatives, we're computing the sums [INAUDIBLE]. So ever step of gradient descent we end up computing something like this that sums over our m training examples and so the term batch gradient descent refers to the fact that we're looking at the entire batch of training examples. And again, it's really not a great name, but this is what machine learning people call it. And it turns out that there are sometimes other versions of gradient descent that are not batch versions, but they are instead. Do not look at the entire training set but look at small subsets of the training sets at a time. And we'll talk about those versions later in this course as well. But for now using the algorithm we just learned about or using batch gradient descent you now know how to implement gradient descent for linear regression. \n",
    "9:05\n",
    "So that's linear regression with gradient descent. If you've seen advanced linear algebra before, so some of you may have taken a class in advanced linear algebra. You might know that there exists a solution for numerically solving for the minimum of the cost function j without needing to use an iterative algorithm like gradient descent. Later in this course we'll talk about that method as well that just solves for the minimum of the cost function j without needing these multiple steps of gradient descent. That other method is called the normal equations method. But in case you've heard of that method it turns out that gradient descent will scale better to larger data sets than that normal equation method. And now that we know about gradient descent we'll be able to use it in lots of different contexts and we'll use it in lots of different machine learning problems as well. \n",
    "9:55\n",
    "So congrats on learning about your first machine learning algorithm. We'll later have exercises in which we'll ask you to implement gradient descent and hopefully see these algorithms right for yourselves. But before that I first want to tell you in the next set of videos. The first one to tell you about a generalization of the gradient descent algorithm that will make it much more powerful. And I guess I'll tell you about that in the next video. "
